# The Last of Us Legacy

The Last of Us: Legacy is a single-player survival game set in a zombie apocalyptic world. The game is conducted in a turn-based manner, where each player character receives a specific number of action points per turn, which they can use to move, attack or cure zombies, or use special actions.

## Features

- **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Each player character has a specific number of action points per turn.
- **Hero Expansion:** Start with one hero and gain additional heroes by curing zombies.
- **Survival Objective:** The goal is to survive and cure enough zombies to build a community to withstand the apocalypse.

## Characters

### Heroes
Heroes are the characters that the player can control. There are several types of heroes, each providing different assets to help win the game. Heroes have health that decreases when attacked and are removed from the game if their health reaches 0. The goal is to protect and expand the pool of heroes.

Hero Actions:
- **Move**
- **Attack a zombie**
- **Cure a zombie**
- **Use unique action (class-dependent)**

Hero Types:
- **Explorer:** Reveals the entire map for 1 turn when a supply is used.
- **Medic:** Heals heroes or themselves using 1 supply per healing.
- **Fighter:** Attacks multiple times in a turn without using action points when a supply is used.

### Zombies
Zombies are threats that the player cannot control but can cure or attack. Killing a zombie spawns another somewhere on the map. Additional zombies spawn each turn. Curing a zombie turns it into a hero for the player.

## Collectibles

- **Vaccines:** Essential for winning the game by curing zombies and recruiting new heroes.
- **Supplies:** Enable heroes to use their special actions.

## Gameplay Flow

The player starts in a 15x15 grid map with one hero and 10 zombies, seeing only adjacent cells. The player collects vaccines, cures or kills zombies, and aims to survive. The game ends when all vaccines are collected and used, or all heroes are defeated. The player wins by collecting and using all vaccines and having 5 or more heroes alive.

## Dependencies

- **Java:** Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed.
